# Better FF Reader

This extension adds a toolbar button that acts just like the builtin reader mode, but with a list of urls where the extension auto-activates and customisation options for the reader mode.

## To install

 - `git clone https://github.com/IsaacKhor/better-ff-reader.git`
 - Load the newly-created directory in `about:debugging` `Load Temporary Add-on`
